Personal Website

This repository hosts the code for my personal website, a platform where I share my professional journey, skills, and achievements. Designed with simplicity in mind, it utilizes HTML and CSS to create a clean and responsive user experience.

Features

The website is divided into several sections for easy navigation:

About Me: Learn about my background, interests, and the path that led me to where I am today.
Experience: A detailed look at my professional history, including roles I've held and key projects I've contributed to.
Skills: An overview of the technical and soft skills I've developed over the years.
Certifications: A showcase of certifications and courses I've completed to further my knowledge and expertise.
Contact: How to get in touch with me, whether for opportunities, collaborations, or just to say hi.
Project Structure

index.html: The entry point of the website containing the HTML structure.
style/: This directory houses the style.css file, which applies styling across the website.
assets/: A folder containing static resources such as images, documents (like PDFs of certifications), and any other media used on the site.
